# Flappy-Bird-Java-Edition
A fun little bare bones recreation of Flappy Bird in Java I did back in 2020. The application's screen dimensions simulate that of an actual mobile device to mimic the original.



## Instructions on how to install the game:
1.) Download the FlappyBird.jar file
2.) Unpack the downloaded file, or move it to a directory that you can easily access
3.) Double tap the jar file to run the application
4.) Done!

## Instructions on how to play the game:
- To start you can either press the spacebar or right click your mouse / touch pad.
- Use either to control the bird and avoid obstacles
- Try to avoid obstacles for as long as possible to see how high you can get your score to
- Rinse and repeat until your claim your next high score

## Features:
- Awesome 2D graphics
- Cool sound design
- Dynamic characters switching
- Dynamic day and night level switching after game over
- Parabolic simulated physics
- Smooth 60 Hz refresh rate
- Multiple input controls (spacebar, touch pad / mouse, up arrow key, and or w key)
